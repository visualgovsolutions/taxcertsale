 * Simple test for CountyConfigSettings component.

 * TODO: Expand these tests to include more comprehensive testing of the component's functionality.
 * Currently, there are issues with mocking the antd components which need to be resolved.
 * Future tests should cover:
 * - Rendering of form fields and tabs
 * - Form validation and submission
 * - Handling of various form states (loading, error, success)
 * - Conditional rendering based on form values
