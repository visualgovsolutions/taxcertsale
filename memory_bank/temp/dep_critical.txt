### Critical Path Dependencies

1. **Foundation Layer** (Level 1)
   - Project Setup → Backend Basics → Authentication → Database → GraphQL API → Frontend Basics
   - These form the technical foundation and must be completed first

2. **Core Business Logic** (Level 2)
   - Database Connection Management → Certificate Management → Auction System Core
   - Payment Processing depends on Authentication and Certificate Management
   - County Administration depends on Database and Certificate Management

3. **Advanced Features** (Level 3)
   - Advanced Search builds on Property Management System from Level 2
   - Map Visualization requires Property Management foundation
   - API Development needs stable GraphQL foundation from Level 1
   - Mobile Optimization needs solid Frontend Basics from Level 1

### Parallel Development Opportunities

These tasks can be developed in parallel with limited dependencies:
- Frontend components (once Frontend Basics are complete)
- DevOps setup (can start early in parallel with other tasks)
- Documentation (can be developed alongside technical implementations)
- Security implementations (can be integrated throughout development)
