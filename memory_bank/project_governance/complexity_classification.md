# Task Complexity Classification Guide

## Overview

This document defines the criteria used to classify tasks in the Florida Tax Certificate Sale platform by complexity level. Understanding these classifications helps with resource allocation, sprint planning, and estimating development timelines.

Tasks are classified into three levels of complexity:

- **Level 1**: Foundation and basic functionality
- **Level 2**: Intermediate complexity and core business features
- **Level 3**: Advanced features with high technical complexity

## Level 3 Complexity Determination

Level 3 tasks represent the highest complexity in the system and are identified by meeting multiple criteria from the following categories:

### 1. Technical Sophistication

Tasks qualify as Level 3 when they include:

- Implementation of advanced algorithms (machine learning, predictive models)
- Complex distributed systems architecture
- Sophisticated state management across multiple services
- Implementation of specialized technology domains (GIS, financial modeling)
- Advanced performance optimization techniques
- Complex concurrency and race condition handling

### 2. Integration Complexity

Tasks qualify as Level 3 when they:

- Coordinate across 3+ subsystems simultaneously
- Require synchronization between distributed components
- Implement complex data federation across multiple counties
- Integrate with external systems requiring specialized protocols
- Handle complex transaction management across service boundaries

### 3. Data Processing Scale

Tasks qualify as Level 3 when they involve:

- High-volume, high-throughput data processing
- Implementation of multi-tier caching strategies
- Complex search indexing and query optimization
- Real-time analytics on large datasets
- Sophisticated data sharding or partitioning strategies

### 4. Regulatory/Compliance Requirements

Tasks qualify as Level 3 when they implement:

- Tamper-evident audit trails with legal requirements
- Complex Florida-specific regulatory compliance features
- Financial compliance spanning multiple jurisdictions
- Advanced security requirements (fraud detection, intrusion prevention)
- Legally-binding document generation with complex rules

### 5. User Experience Sophistication

Tasks qualify as Level 3 when they provide:

- Highly personalized or adaptive interfaces
- Real-time collaborative features
- Predictive or anticipatory functionality
- Complex workflow orchestration
- Advanced visualization of multi-dimensional data

## Classification Examples

### Example 1: Advanced Bidding Strategies (Level 3)

This qualifies as Level 3 because it combines:
- Technical Sophistication: Bidding strategy algorithms and simulation models
- Integration Complexity: Coordination between auction, notification, and payment systems
- Regulatory Requirements: Compliance with Florida bidding rules
- UX Sophistication: Predictive bidding recommendations and visualization

### Example 2: Basic Property List View (Level 1)

This is Level 1 because it:
- Uses standard UI components and patterns
- Involves minimal integration (just fetching data from a single API)
- Has straightforward data requirements
- Implements common UI patterns

### Example 3: Certificate Batch Management (Level 2)

This is Level 2 because it:
- Has moderate technical complexity with time-triggered workflows
- Requires integration between several services
- Involves regulatory requirements but of moderate complexity
- Has standard administrative UI requirements

## Decision Process

When determining if a task is Level 3, ask:
1. Does the task meet criteria from at least 3 of the 5 categories above?
2. Is the task significantly more complex than typical Level 2 tasks?
3. Does the task require specialized expertise not needed for most other features?
4. Would the task benefit from additional technical planning and architecture review?

If the answer to at least 3 of these questions is "yes," the task should be classified as Level 3.


## Complexity Classification Matrix

The following matrix provides a quick reference guide for determining task complexity levels:

| Criteria | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 |
|----------|---------|---------|----------|
| Technical Sophistication | Standard patterns and libraries | Moderate algorithmic complexity | Advanced algorithms, ML/AI, complex state management |
| Integration Complexity | Single service or API | 2-3 integrated services | 3+ services with complex coordination |
| Data Processing Scale | Basic CRUD operations | Moderate volume, basic optimization | High volume, advanced caching, complex queries |
| Regulatory Requirements | Basic validation | Standard Florida compliance | Complex regulatory or legal requirements |
| UX Sophistication | Standard components | Interactive, dynamic interfaces | Adaptive, predictive, or collaborative UIs |
| Team Expertise | Standard skills | Some specialized knowledge | Requires expert-level specialized skills |
| Development Time | Days to 1-2 weeks | 2-4 weeks | 1+ months |

This matrix serves as a guideline. The final complexity level should be determined by evaluating the task against all criteria and applying the decision process outlined above.
