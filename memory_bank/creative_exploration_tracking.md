# Creative Exploration Tracking

## Overview

This document tracks the status of components that require creative exploration before implementation. It helps coordinate the transition from creative phase to implementation phase for complex components.

## Creative Exploration Components

| Component | Complexity | Status | Design Doc | Decisions Made | Open Questions | Dependencies |
|-----------|------------|--------|------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| Bidding Engine | Level 2 | Planned | [Link to doc] | None | - Websocket vs SSE<br>- State recovery approach<br>- Scaling strategy | Certificate Management |
| Certificate Batch Management | Level 2 | Planned | [Link to doc] | None | - Scheduling mechanism<br>- Batch grouping strategy | Certificate Management |
| Advanced Search System | Level 3 | Not Started | - | None | - ML framework selection<br>- Index optimization | Property Management |
| GIS & Map Visualization | Level 3 | Not Started | - | None | - Map provider<br>- Data layer strategy | Property Management |
| Advanced Bidding Strategies | Level 3 | Not Started | - | None | - Rules engine design<br>- Automation limits | Bidding Engine |
| AI & Decision Support | Level 3 | Not Started | - | None | - Model selection<br>- Training approach | Certificate Management, Auction System |
| Multi-County Management | Level 3 | Not Started | - | None | - Federation architecture<br>- Cross-county search | County Management |
| Payment Processing System | Level 2 | Planned | [Link to doc] | None | - Gateway selection<br>- Transaction management | Auction System, User Management |

## Creative Exploration Schedule

| Phase | Components | Target Completion |
|-------|------------|-------------------|
| Pre-Phase 2 | Bidding Engine, Certificate Batch Management, Payment Processing | Before core implementation begins |
| Pre-Phase 3A | Advanced Search, GIS Visualization | Before UX enhancement features |
| Pre-Phase 3B | Advanced Bidding Strategies | Before financial/strategic features |
| Pre-Phase 3C | Multi-County Management | Before platform expansion features |
| Pre-Phase 3D | AI & Decision Support | Before system enhancement features |

## Exit Criteria for Creative Phase

Components should meet the following criteria before transitioning from creative exploration to implementation:

1. **Architecture Design**: Complete, documented architecture with component diagram
2. **Key Decisions**: All major design decisions documented with rationale
3. **Technical Requirements**: Specific technical requirements identified
4. **POC/Prototype**: Critical technical risks addressed with proof of concept
5. **Dependencies**: All dependencies identified and validated
6. **Implementation Plan**: Clear implementation approach with phasing if needed
