# Implementation Plan: Auction System Core

## Overview
This implementation plan outlines the development of the WebSocket-based Auction System Core for the Florida Tax Certificate Sale platform. This is a Level 2 task that forms a critical component of the system, enabling real-time bidding and certificate management.

## Key Components

### 1. WebSocket-based Bidding Engine
- Socket.io server integration with Express
- Real-time connection management
- Heartbeat mechanism for connection monitoring
- Reconnection handling with bid state recovery

### 2. Certificate Batch Management System
- Database schema for certificate batches
- Time-triggered workflow system
- Configurable closing intervals (hourly, daily, custom)
- Batch monitoring and alerts

### 3. Bidding Interface Components
- Real-time bidding UI with WebSocket integration
- Bid placement form with validation
- Bid history display component
- Outbid notification system

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Backend WebSocket Infrastructure
1. Set up Socket.io on the Express server
2. Implement connection management system
3. Create bidding event handlers
4. Set up heartbeat and reconnection handling

### Phase 2: Certificate Batch Management
1. Create database models for certificate batches
2. Implement batch configuration system
3. Build time-triggered workflow engine
4. Set up monitoring and alerts

### Phase 3: Frontend Bidding Components
1. Create bidding UI components
2. Implement WebSocket client connection
3. Build bid history and notification components
4. Integrate real-time bidding with backend

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing
1. Connect bidding engine with certificate management
2. Implement end-to-end bidding flow
3. Test with simulated auction scenarios
4. Optimize performance for concurrent bidding

## Technical Approach

### Backend Implementation
- Use Socket.io for WebSocket communication
- Implement a service-based architecture
- Store bid state in-memory with database persistence
- Use event-driven architecture for bidding events

### Frontend Implementation
- Use React hooks for WebSocket connection management
- Implement optimistic updates for bidding UI
- Create reusable bidding components
- Use context API for bidding state management

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for bidding logic
- Integration tests for WebSocket communication
- Load testing for concurrent bidding
- End-to-end tests for complete bidding flow

## Requirements Traceability
This implementation fulfills the following requirements from the PRD:

- Real-time bidding interface
- Florida-compliant reverse-auction format
- Interest rate validation
- Certificate batch bidding support
- Automated bid validation
- Bid history tracking
- Last-minute bid extension rules
- Outbid notifications

## Dependencies
- Express server setup (already implemented)
- Database connection (already implemented)
- Authentication system (already implemented)
- Basic frontend components (already implemented)

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| WebSocket performance under load | High | Medium | Implement load testing and scaling strategies |
| Race conditions in bid processing | High | Medium | Use proper locking mechanisms and transaction handling |
| Client-server state synchronization | Medium | High | Implement robust error handling and recovery mechanisms |
| Browser WebSocket compatibility | Medium | Low | Use Socket.io for broad compatibility and fallback mechanisms |
